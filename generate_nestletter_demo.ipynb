    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use the free Cohere API to generate a date-appropriate newsletter for retail store Aldi UK, based on the products they currently sell in their stores. The goal is to create an email-looking newsletter with links to products from the store its customers could buy, all in the form of a marketing email.\n",

    "1. Scrape the special products currently on offer (using Selenium)\n",

    "4. Selecting a relevant subset of products on offer based on the gift ideas (using Sentence Embeddings)\n",
